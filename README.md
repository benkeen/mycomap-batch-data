## Mycomap Batch Data

This is a tool to allow any BC Mycomap contributor generate a CSV file for the batch of submissions.

TODO:

- add query param to override voucher number format check
- loading icon for content
- disable generate button while loading
- run check on every observation?
  - Nope. Too slow. Can check for duplicates between the loaded batch, but not across all observations. :(
